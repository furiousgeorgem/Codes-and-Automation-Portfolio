# Codes and Automation Portfolio

A collection of short, focused automation and data‑processing tools I built to solve real tasks (music catalog matching, reporting utilities, and utilities for dataset handling). Each project folder includes a README with usage examples and the script(s) required to run the tool.

Highlights
- furious_multi_matcher — fuzzy, high‑speed track matching for music catalogs
- furious_reporter — small reporting utilities for CSV-based data
- amazon_songs — scripts for working with the Amazon songs dataset

How to run the examples
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/furiousgeorgem/Codes-and-Automation-Portfolio.git
   cd "Codes and Automation Portfolio"

2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. See per-project README files for specific usage examples, sample inputs, and expected output files.

Project organization
- furious_multi_matcher/ — fuzzy multi-matcher with example usage and sample input format
- furious_reporter/ — small reporting scripts and README with examples
- amazon_songs/ — dataset-specific helper scripts and README
- archived_scripts/ — (optional) older or backup scripts (keeps repository root tidy)

Why this repo exists
This repo demonstrates:
- Practical automation for data workflows
- Small, testable scripts that solve focused problems
- Clear README-driven examples so reviewers can run pieces locally

If you want any section shortened, expanded, or reworded (e.g., add a short one-line bio, contact link, or live demo GIF), tell me what to include and I’ll prepare a revised draft.
