## Overview

This repository showcases my Python scripts and automation projects, primarily focused on music data curation and processing. Each project includes:  

- A Python script (`.py`) implementing the automation or analysis  
- A Markdown explanation (`.md`) describing the functionality, usage, and outputs  
- Optional assets or examples to demonstrate results  

This portfolio highlights both my technical skills and my workflow documentation, allowing others to understand, replicate, or extend my work.
